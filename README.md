# Stock_Analysis
Analysis of 12 stock tickers to find total volume and daily return

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to analyze twelve stock indexes to see which one(s) would be the best investment. A VBA code was written because the excel data was too large to analyze manually. This code would need to analyze all the stocks in the dataset and the user should be able to choose which year they wanted analyzed. In the end, this code was refractored to make the code run faster. The analysis will center on how effective refactoring the code was at speeding up the code, as well as any advantages or disadvantages that can come from refactoring the code.
